                            Harry, was left with his lightning bolt-shaped scar.

                            the books. According to Half-Blood Prince, Azkaban is "in the middle of the North Sea".
                            Sirius Black says that when he escaped from Azkaban while in his animagus form as a dog, he
                            swam to Britain and then travelled northwards to get to Hogwarts. This implies that Azkaban
                            is at a lower latitude than Hogwarts, which is in Scotland. Although Azkaban's appearance is
                            not described in detail in the books, it is mentioned to have grounds outside the prison
                            where prisoners who have died are buried. In the film adaptations it appears to be a

                            barrier between platforms 9 and 10.

                            Rowling discovered after the books were published that she had confused the layout of King's
                            Cross with that of Euston station, and that platforms 9 and 10 at King's Cross were not the
                            ones between which she had meant her magical platform to be placed. There is no platform
                            between lines 9 and 10 at King's Cross. To solve this, the filmmakers re-numbered platforms
                            4 and 5 for the duration of filming. In reality, at both King's Cross and Euston, platforms
                            9 and 10 are separated by railway lines. The exterior shots in the film are of the St
                            Pancras Renaissance London Hotel, which is part of St Pancras station, adjacent to King's
                            Cross station. From the outside St Pancras is much more visually dramatic than King's
                            Cross.<br>

                            goblin clerks work at tasks such as counting coins and updating account ledgers. Within,
                            wizards and witches keep their money and other valuables in vaults that are protected by
                            very complex and very strong security measures. The vaults extend for miles under London and
                            are accessible through rough stone passageways navigated by magic carts that travel speedily
                            along their tracks. Gringotts also offers Muggle-Wizarding currency exchange. <br>

                            they get married in Deathly Hallows. It is located overlooking a beach outside the village
                            of Tinworth in Cornwall. The cottage served as a hiding place for Harry, Ron, Hermione,
                            Luna, Dean Thomas, Mr. Ollivander and Griphook after they managed to escape from
                            imprisonment in Malfoy Manor. Dobby the house-elf was buried in the garden after he died
                            with a tombstone reading "Here lies Dobby, a free elf". During the war, Bill himself was the
                            Secret-Keeper for Bill and Fleur.

                            The Shell Cottage scenes were filmed on Freshwater West beach in the Pembrokeshire Coast
                            National Park, Wales. <br>
