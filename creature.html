                    fictional wizarding world contained in the Harry Potter series and connected media, all created by
                    British author J. K. Rowling. Throughout the seven main books of the series, Harry and his friends
                    encounter many of these creatures on their adventures in Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest, or other
                    locations throughout the Wizarding World. In addition, students learn to take care of creatures such
                    as Hippogriffs and Unicorns in the Care of Magical Creatures class at Hogwarts. Rowling has also
                    written Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, a guide to the magical beasts found in the series,
                    and based on the fictional textbook of the same name written by Newt Scamander and used by students
                    at Hogwarts. A diverse menagerie of exotic magical beasts live inside J.K. Rowling’s
                    Wizarding World. Read on to learn about the many magical creatures of the Harry Potter universe.

                            in the Harry Potter series is none other than an owl of the Wizarding World. The entire film
                            franchise begins with a shot of an owl perched on the Privet Drive street sign, overlooking
                            baby Harry Potter's arrival in the muggle village of Little Whinging. And within the first
                            30 minutes of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, we've met his loyal pet Hedwig, who
                            dies saving him six years later.

                            Owls who live among the wizardkind posses the power of delivering mail to recipients without
                            needing an address. A witch or wizard must use one of the following enchantments to avoid
                            being found by owl: Repelling, Disguising or Masking spells.

                        <li style="text-align:center">House-elves are creatures who in the Wizarding World are typically
                            treated as slaves. They remain loyal to their master until they are granted a piece of
                            clothing, a symbol of freedom and dignity. Until then, they often wear pillow cases or
                            similar, haphazard scraps of cloth and must punish themselves brutally if they act against
                            the wishes of their master. House-elves have their own wandless use of magic, which includes
                            apparating (disappearing on the spot and appearing elsewhere).

                            One major Harry Potter fan favorite happens to be a house-elf: Dobby! Dobby is originally
                            property of the Malfoy family, until Harry Potter tricks Lucius Malfoy into giving Dobby a
                            sock. During Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows — Part 1, Dobby dies trying to save
                            Harry's life. <br></li>

                            break-ins performed by Professor Quirrell in Sorcerer's Stone and by Harry, Hermione and Ron
                            in Deathly Hallows – Part 2).

                            Goblins are humanoids that coexist relatively peacefully with witches and wizards, despite
                            their bad attitudes. They can perform magic without wands and have their own native
                            language, humorously called Gobbledygook.

                            Harry meets his first Goblin when Hagrid escorts him to withdraw wizarding currency for his
                            school supplies. <br></li>

                            fear of spiders) meets the king of all eight-legged creatures face to face inside the
                            Forbidden Forest. Joined by Harry, the two meet Aragog, Hagrid's blind acromantula who
                            fathers tens of thousands of spiders and secretly lives on the edge of the school grounds
                            (until he dies in the Half-Blood Prince).

                            These hairy creatures produce deadly venom, feed on humans and have a legspan that can reach
                            15 feet. Most surprising is their ability to speak perfect English, which must come in handy
                            to lure and torture their prey.<br>

                            person, ghost or cat looks a basilisk in the eye indirectly, be it through a reflection or
                            camera lens, the victim will be Petrified and turned to stone. The giant serpent also has
                            incredibly powerful venom, one of the only substances in the Wizarding World strong enough
                            to destroy one of Voldemort's horcruxes <br></li>

                            blue mischief-makers who enjoy tormenting humans by destroying their belongings, lifting
                            them by the ears and causing general mayhem. The always clever Hermione restores the
                            classroom to order by performing a Freezing Charm that makes them sit still for once.

                            They tend to be less intelligent than witches and wizards but aren't nearly as dimwitted as
                            trolls. Giants can learn English (and also have their own language), but good luck simply
                            talking your way through a dispute. They have a history of being violent and are difficult
                            to detain since spells don't have much effect on them.

                            Disclaimer: not all giants are bad! While most take Voldemort's side during the First and
                            Second Wizarding Wars, we have the pleasure of meeting Hagrid's brother Grawp (AKA Grawpy).
                            Grawpy is kind to Harry and his friends, protects the centaurs of the Forbidden Forrest, and
                            goes after the evil Professor Umbridge when she crosses the line. Fun fact: he has quite the
                            crush on our heroine Hermione.<br>

                            lured by the smell of blood, but when treated kindly allow humans to ride them.

                            Harry couldn't see thestrals until he witnessed the murder of Cedric Diggory during the
                            Goblet of Fire. Harry's parents died in his presence when he was a baby, but since he was
                            shielded in his crib, he was unable to see thestrals before Cedric's death. <br>
